//string indexing 

let firstname = "Biswajit"; // if we are going to give a sting value to the variable then it should be between the double quotation mark. Rememeber that.

// B   i  s  w  a  j  i  t
// 0   1  2  3  4  5  6  7 

console.log(firstname[3]);// sting indexing starts from the 0.

//If we want to know the length of the string then use 
console.log(firstname.length);//it will show the length of string and spaced are included.
// Length starts from the first character and it starts with the value 0 then goes on accendingly.

// Last length
console.log(firstname[firstname.length - 1]);
console.log(firstname[firstname.length - 3]);
