//1value  = this is invalid.
//value1  = this is valid.

var Biswajit = 100;
var value1 = 13;
// if we want to get power of some value then we have to use ** is will work as the power function 
//example console.log(value1 ** 2) and for root power 0.5 cause root means 0.5 


// Only underscore _ or dollar sign is valid
//first_name  = (valid)  this writing called snake case writing
